Octree Algorithm for Point Cloud Data Processing

* Introduction:
    This program implements an Octree algorithm for processing point cloud data. It allows you to create an Octree structure, filter points, and visualize data.

* Installation:
    Clone this repository to your local machine

    Navigate to the project directory

    Install the required dependencies (if any) by running: pip install -r requirements.txt
  
* Running the Program:
    This program expects point cloud data in the form of a LAS file. You should place your LAS file in the same directory as the project.
  
    Make sure you have installed Python and the required dependencies (if any)

    Navigate to the project directory

    Execute the main script: python modifyed_octree_algorithm.py
